The project was completed within the Hicounselor program (https://hicounselor.com/) to apply data analysis skills to a real-world problem. The dataset was provided by Hicounselor.

This project has provided me with a profound comprehension of the intricacies involved in analyzing real-world databases through SQL. How to delve deeper into optimizing insights from datasets, employing Python to refine data pre-processing for enhanced upcoming performance. Furthermore, learning how to use SQL to extract valuable information from databases efficiently.

For those curious about the tools involved, here are the technologies spotlighted in this journey:

SQL: The cornerstone of database analysis.

Python: Empowering data preprocessing for utmost efficiency.

Pandas: A tool to efficiently handle and analyze data.

Feel free to explore the repository and engage with these technologies firsthand. If you have any queries or insights to share, don't hesitate to connect. Here's to embracing the art of database exploration and technological collaboration! ðŸš€
